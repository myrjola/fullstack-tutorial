# Apollo tutorial

Based on [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html), but I added some examples for pagination. ðŸš€

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```
